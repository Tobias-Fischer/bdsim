Block diagrams for Python
=========================

This Python package enables modelling and simulation of dynamic systems conceptualized in block diagram form, but represented in terms of Python class and method calls.

Unlike Simulink or LabView we write Python code rather than drawing boxes and wires.  Wires can communicate any Python type such as scalars, strings, lists, dictionaries, numpy arrays, other objects, and even functions.
