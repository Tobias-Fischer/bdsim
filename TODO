Port object instead of tuple for slices
implement * operator and __setitem__

evaulate once in compile and record all wire signals

implement second index for vector indexing

win,wout, list out wire widths at each block

cycles, trace them out (depth first search) and check for stateful blocks in each

integrate symbolics, ideas from simupy

setinput should raise NotImplemented for Source blocks
rename Port subclass as Plug, returned by __set/getitem__
